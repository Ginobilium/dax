# DAX

Duke ARTIQ Extensions (DAX).

DAX is a library that extends the capabilities of [ARTIQ](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq)
while maintaining a vanilla ARTIQ experience.
The goal of the project is to provide tools for system organization/abstraction and
to improve usability by automating common functionality.

Supplementary communication tools for DAX are available in the
[DAX comtools package](https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax-comtools).
Nix scripts for this project can be found in the
[Nix scripts repository](https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/nix-scripts).

More information about ARTIQ can be found in the [ARTIQ manual](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/).

A side-project of DAX is DAX.sim: a *functional simulator* for ARTIQ hardware that allows
users to run experiment code without the need of a physical core device.
DAX.sim can help users to test, debug, and verify the functionality of their code.

## Usage

Users can import DAX and the ARTIQ experiment environment at once using the following import statement:

```python
from dax.experiment import *
```

Users that would like to use DAX.sim can do so by annotating their device DB in the following way:

```python
from dax.sim import enable_dax_sim

device_db = enable_dax_sim(enable=True, ddb={
    # Your regular device db...
})
``` 

## Testing

To run the DAX unit tests, execute the following command in the root directory of DAX:

```shell
python3 -m unittest
```
