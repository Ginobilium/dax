Welcome to DAX's documentation!
===============================

As you might have noticed, the DAX documentation has some rough edges.
This preliminary documentation is mainly intended for internal usage and
currently **only contains autogenerated content**.
In addition to this website with documentation,
DAX also has a `wiki page <https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax/-/wikis/home>`_.

Project website: https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax.
