    """A trap DC module using a Zotino device, inheriting from AD53XX.

    This module controls a Zotino used for trap DC. The device has 32 channels of DC voltage output that can be set
    using functions from this module.

    Solution files, which can be .csv or generated by a .py file, can be read into a python object and compressed
    for efficient zotino output. A map file is used to connect the output channels with the solution file pins.

    Using the prepared solution files, this module provides functions to shuttle these solutions at a predefined
    speed. There is the option to use DMA caching to lower the necessary amount of slack to prepend to your
    experiments.

    Notes when considering using this module:

    - Functions are provided to return the expected amount of slack needed to shuttle a solution at a given speed
      without underflow. However, this is meant to be an approximate calculation and can be configured as needed.
    - Everything in this module is Zotino specific. As other DC traps are needed they should be created separately.
